# zombiedice
The objective of this project is to build an online version of the tabletop dice game ‘Zombie Dice’. In this game, two players faceoff to be the first to consume a total of 13 brains. Logged in players take turns rolling virtual dice from the dice pool, while the application tracks scores, turns, etc. Once a winner is determined, game statistics are stored in the database. The game is played using a web browser in real-time, and no page refreshing would be required until the game is completed.
